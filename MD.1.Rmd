## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

df <- complaints
head(df)

```

```{r}
# Bar graph counting product types

head(df)

p.type1 <- function(comp.data) {
  comp.data %>% 
    count(product)
}

p.type1(df)


plot1 <- p.type1(df)

plot_ly(data = plot1,
             x = ~product,
             y = ~n,
             type = "bar"
) %>% 
     layout(title = "Count of CFPB Complaints by Product Type",
            xaxis = list(title = "Product Name"),
            yaxis = list(title = "Count of Product Type")
)

```

```{r}

# Tabulates companies whose consumer consent was NOT provided in a Timely Manner in NY State

head(df)

p.type2 <- function(comp.data) {
  comp.data %>%
    filter(consumer_consent_provided == "Consent not provided") %>%
    filter(timely_response == "No") %>% 
    filter(state =="NY") %>%
    count(company)
}

p.type2(df)


plot2 <- p.type2(df)

plot_ly(data = plot2,
             x = ~company,
             y = ~n,
             type = "bar"
) %>% 
     layout(title = "NY State Company Complaints Where Consumer Consent was NOT Provided In Timely Manner",
            xaxis = list(title = "Company"),
            yaxis = list(title = "Count of Occurences")
)
